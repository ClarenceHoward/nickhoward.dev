Nick Howard's personal website.


## Inspiration and Attribution

The design, styling, and many of the resources of this website were inspired by the tutorial and code provided by [Ade-mir](https://github.com/Ade-mir/). 

The background grid, which I used as the basis for Conway's Game of Life, was inspired by work from the Youtuber Hyperplexed which can be found here https://codepen.io/Hyperplexed/pen/zYWvXMM .
